## Basic Details

### Team Name: [FOUR]

### Team Members

### Project Description

We made a small project which has mainly 2 webpages, one with a Havizgod Ball catching simulator and the other with seems important but absolute weird and useless informations with a 5star button.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

[What ridiculous problem are you solving?]
we are trying to solve a game which can be won by catching all the balls that are dropped from the divine eternity but the bucket has some weird holes ....

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

[How are you solving it? Keep it fun!]
we are trying to catch the almighty god level balls but we cannot have any option but just to hear what humiliations the hgp bot offers to us ..
